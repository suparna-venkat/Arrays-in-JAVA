# DSA-with-Java
2026 goals, honestly.... show up even on boring days. get stupidly consistent with DSA in Java and stop overthinking a lot.. build a GitHub that actually reflects effort, get better at problem-solving. balance college, coding, and life without burning out or disappearing. read more, think deeper, speak clearer. be disciplined.
